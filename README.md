# Fault Classification of High Voltage Transmission Line Using 1D Convolutional Neural Network

  Fast and accurate classification of transmission line faults is necessary to maintain the availability of the electrical power supply. Previous fault classification methods relied on expert knowledge of analyzing current and voltage signals when a fault occurs. This study aims to apply the one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) method to analyze current and voltage signals and classify them into three types of faults: short-circuit fault, non-system fault, and lightning fault quickly and precisely. The experimental results of the proposed method showed high generalization and performance, so this method has great potential to be applied in the development of intelligent classification systems in the future.
